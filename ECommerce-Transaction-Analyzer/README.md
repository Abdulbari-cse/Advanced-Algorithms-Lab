#  E-Commerce Transaction Analyzer (C)

##  Project Overview
This project is a **high-performance E-Commerce Transaction Analyzer** built using the **C programming language**.  
It is designed to efficiently process **large transaction datasets** using advanced **sorting and searching algorithms**.

The system reads transaction data from a CSV file and applies optimized algorithms to analyze performance.

---

##  Key Features

- Reads real-world transaction data from CSV  
- Implements **Merge Sort** and **Quick Sort**  
- Uses **Binary Search** for fast transaction lookup  
   Performance benchmarking (swaps & comparisons)  
-  Randomized pivot strategy to avoid worst-case Quick Sort  
-  Efficient memory handling in pure C

---

## Algorithms Used

| Algorithm | Purpose | Complexity |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Merge Sort | Stable high-performance sorting | O(n log n) |
| Quick Sort (Random Pivot) | Fast average-case sorting | O(n log n) |
| Binary Search | Fast lookup by Invoice ID | O(log n) |
