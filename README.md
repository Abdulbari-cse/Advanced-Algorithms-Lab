##  About This Repository

This repository contains **high-performance implementations of Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** developed as part of my Master's coursework.  
The projects focus on:

- Algorithm Optimization
- Time & Space Complexity Analysis
- Low-level Memory Management
- File Handling & Data Processing
- Divide & Conquer Techniques

All implementations are developed using **pure C and C++ without relying on STL**, to strengthen core algorithmic foundations.
